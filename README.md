Nutrition Label

Ok so I had to post this one becasue this was really fun to make, so continuing my way through freeCodeCamp's course work this time around we go to code a nutrition label like you find on food & wow this is what I want to do more of.

The only problem now is dealing with the hand cramps from all the coding, ouch.
